# Mixins

We have a number of [mixins](/mixins) to help you get started. The stable ones are installed
by default by the script:

* exec
* kubernetes
* helm
* azure

You can install a new version of a mixin, or install a mixin that someone else made
using the `porter mixin install` command built into porter.

```console
$ porter mixin install terraform --feed-url https://cdn.deislabs.io/porter/atom.xml
installed terraform mixin
terraform mixin v0.1.0-ralpha.1+elderflowerspritz (edf8778)
```

All of the DeisLabs created mixes are published to the same feed: `https://cdn.deislabs.io/porter/atom.xml`.
