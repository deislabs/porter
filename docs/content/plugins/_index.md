The Porter client is extensible and anyone can write a plugin to integrate with
Porter. Plugins extend the Porter client, reimplementing Porter's default
functionality. For example, Porter saves claims and credential sets using the local
filesystem to ~/.porter by default. A plugin can change that behavior to save
them to cloud storage instead. 

[Plugins are very different from mixins][vs], which give you building blocks for
authoring bundles. There are a couple [types of plugins][types] and a single
plugin binary may contain multiple implementations.

See the [Search Guide][search-guide] on how to search for available plugins and/or
add your own to the list.
