The Porter client is extensible and anyone can write a plugin to integrate with
Porter. [Plugins are very different from mixins][vs], which give you building
blocks for authoring bundles. There are a couple [types of plugins][types] and
each plugin binary may contain multiple implementations.

See the [Search Guide][search-guide] on how to search for available plugins and/or
add your own to the list.
