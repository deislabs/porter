Once you have built a bundle with Porter, the next step is to share the bundle and invocation image so others can use it. Porter uses OCI (Docker) registries to share both CNAB bundle manifest and invocation images.

## Preparing For Bundle Publishing

Before you can publish your bundle, you must first run a `porter build` command. This will create the invocation image so it can be pushed to an OCI (Docker) registry along with your CNAB bundle manifest. It's a good idea to work with your bundle and test it locally before you publish it to a registry.

## Bundle Publish

Once you are satisfied with the bundle, the next step is to publish the bundle! Bundle publishing involves pushing the both the invocation image and the CNAB bundle manifest to an OCI registry. Porter uses [docker tags](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/) for both invocation images and CNAB bundle manifests. These are defined in your `porter.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: kube-example
version: 0.1.0
description: "An example Porter bundle using Kubernetes"
invocationImage: getporter/kubernetes-installer:latest
tag: getporter/kubernetes:v0.1.0
```

This YAML snippet indicates that the invocation image will be built and tagged as `getporter/kubernetes:latest`. The first part of this reference, `getporter` indicates the registry that the invocation image should eventually be published to. The `kubernetes` segment identifies the image, while the `:latest` portion denotes a specific version. Note that the `invocationImage` field is optional and may be omitted entirely.  If so, its value will be derived from the required `tag` value, which we'll discuss next.

Much like the `invocationImage` attribute is used to control the name of resulting Docker invocation image, the `tag` attribute is used to specify the name and location of the resulting CNAB bundle. In both cases, when you are ready to publish your bundle, it would be a good idea to provide specific versions for both of these, such as `v1.0.0`. We recommend using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for both the invocation image and the bundle. We also recommend specifying the same registry for both, in order to simplify access to your bundle and invocation image by end users.

Once you have provided values for these, run the `porter build` command one last time to verify that your invocation image can be successfully built and to ensure that the value you specified in `invocationImage` is correct.

Next, run the `porter publish` command in order to push the invocation image to the specified repository and to regenerate a CNAB bundle manifest using this newly pushed image. You should see output like the following:

```
$ porter publish
Pushing CNAB invocation image...
The push refers to repository [docker.io/getporter/kubernetes-installer]

Rewriting CNAB bundle.json...
Starting to copy image getporter/kubernetes-installer:latest...
Completed image getporter/kubernetes-installer:latest copy
Bundle tag docker.io/getporter/kubernetes:v0.1.0 pushed successfully, with digest "sha256:10a41e6d5af73f2cebe4bf6d368bdf5ccc39e641117051d30f88cf0c69e4e456"
```

Note: you can safely ignore the `WARN[0005] reference for unknown type: application/vnd.cnab.config.v1+json` message, if it appears.

When this command is complete, your CNAB bundle manifest and invocation image will have been successfully pushed to the specified OCI registry. It can then be installed with the `porter install` command:

```
$ porter install --tag getporter/kubernetes:v0.1.0 -c kool-kred
installing kube-example...
executing porter install configuration from /cnab/app/porter.yaml
Install Hello World App
```

The bundle can also be pulled with specified digest:

```
$ porter install --tag getporter/kubernetes@sha256:10a41e6d5af73f2cebe4bf6d368bdf5ccc39e641117051d30f88cf0c69e4e456 -c kool-kred
installing kube-example...
executing porter install configuration from /cnab/app/porter.yaml
Install Hello World App
```

The later example ensures immutability for your bundle. After you've initially run `porter publish`, your tagged reference, such as `getporter/kubernetes:v0.1.0` can be updated with subsequent `porter publish` commands. However, the digested version `getporter/kubernetes@sha256:10a41e6d5af73f2cebe4bf6d368bdf5ccc39e641117051d30f88cf0c69e4e456` will not change. If you'd like to publish different version of the bundle, you will need to update minimally the `tag` attribute and optionally the `invocationImage` attribute, before running `porter publish` again.  (Porter will detect the manifest change and automatically run a new bundle and invocation image build prior to publishing.)

## Publish Archived Bundles

The `porter publish` command can also be used to publish an [archived](/archive-bundles/) bundle to a registry. To publish an archived bundle, the publish command is used with the `-a <filename>` and `--tag <repo/name:tag>` flags. For example, to publish a bundle in the `mybunz1.1.tgz` file to `getporter/megabundle:1.1.0`, you would run the following command:

```
porter publish -a mybunz1.1.tgz --tag getporter/megabundle:1.1.0
```

## Image References After Publishing

When a bundle is published, the images that it will use are copied into the location of the published bundle. This simplifies access control and management of artifacts in the repository. Consider the following `porter.yaml` snippet:

```
name: spring-music
version: 0.5.0
description: "Run the Spring Music Service on Kubernetes and Digital Ocean PostgreSQL"
invocationImage: jeremyrickard/porter-do:v0.5.0
tag: jeremyrickard/porter-do-bundle:v0.5.0

images:
  spring-music:
      description: "Spring Music Example"
      imageType: "docker"
      repository: "jeremyrickard/spring-music"
      digest: "sha256:8f1133d81f1b078c865cdb11d17d1ff15f55c449d3eecca50190eed0f5e5e26f"
```

When this bundle is published, both the invocation image and the `spring-music` image will be copied and stored in the context of the bundle. To see this in action, you can use the `porter inspect` command to see what images will actually be used for a given bundle.

```
Name: spring-music
Description: Run the Spring Music Service on Kubernetes and Digital Ocean PostgreSQL
Version: 0.5.0

Invocation Images:
Image                                                                                                    Type     Digest                                                                    Original Image
jeremyrickard/porter-do-bundle@sha256:74b8622a8b7f09a6802a3fff166c8d1827c9e78ac4e4b9e71e0de872fa5077be   docker   sha256:74b8622a8b7f09a6802a3fff166c8d1827c9e78ac4e4b9e71e0de872fa5077be   jeremyrickard/porter-do:v0.5.0

Images:
Name           Type     Image                                                                                                    Digest                                                                    Original Image
spring-music   docker   jeremyrickard/porter-do-bundle@sha256:8f1133d81f1b078c865cdb11d17d1ff15f55c449d3eecca50190eed0f5e5e26f   sha256:8f1133d81f1b078c865cdb11d17d1ff15f55c449d3eecca50190eed0f5e5e26f   jeremyrickard/spring-music@sha256:8f1133d81f1b078c865cdb11d17d1ff15f55c449d3eecca50190eed0f5e5e26f
```

Here, we can see that both images are stored as `jeremyrickard/porter-do-bundle@sha256:SOMEHASH`. The hash of each matches the digest of the original image. In the case of the invocation image, the image originally was available at `jeremyrickard/porter-do:v0.5.0` with a digest of `sha256:74b8622a8b7f09a6802a3fff166c8d1827c9e78ac4e4b9e71e0de872fa5077be`. After the bundle was published, it is now stored at `jeremyrickard/porter-do-bundle@sha256:74b8622a8b7f09a6802a3fff166c8d1827c9e78ac4e4b9e71e0de872fa5077be`. Similarly, the `spring-music` image was originally referenced with `jeremyrickard/spring-music@sha256:8f1133d81f1b078c865cdb11d17d1ff15f55c449d3eecca50190eed0f5e5e26f`, but after publish the reference becomes `jeremyrickard/porter-do-bundle@sha256:8f1133d81f1b078c865cdb11d17d1ff15f55c449d3eecca50190eed0f5e5e26f`.
