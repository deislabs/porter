You may have noticed a flurry of activity recently on the Porter repositories
and wondered what was afoot. It was all in preparation for the big reveal:
Porter has been accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)!<!--more-->

When Jeremy Rickard and I created Porter less than two years ago, this is what
we hoped for. We wanted to create a user-friendly tool for that would make Cloud
Native Application Bundles (CNAB) accessible and deployments less stressful. It
had to be user-first and community-first, without vendors getting in the way. So
our sights were set on finding an independent home at the CNCF from day one. It
means a lot to us to have built a community around Porter and tricked the CNCF
into letting us in. ðŸ˜‰

Porter is a CNCF [sandbox] project which is the first step for early stage
projects where we can continue to grow and experiment. We have always encouraged
contributions from everyone in the community, with a contribution ladder that
allows anyone to become a maintainer, and we hope that the move to an
independent foundation will attract more contributors, ideas and energy.

Speaking of energy, [Ronan Flynn-Curran][ronan] is giving us a big boost with the new
Porter logo. Meet Michelle the Porter Cat!

TODO: Say something about what we are doing next probably?

TODO: Call to action! ðŸš€
