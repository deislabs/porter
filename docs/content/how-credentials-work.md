When you are authoring a bundle, you can define what credentials your bundle requires such as a github token, cloud provider username/password, etc. Then in your action's steps you can reference the credentials using porter's template language `{{ bundle.credentials.github_token }}`.

Credentials are injected when a bundle is executed (install/upgrade/uninstall/invoke). First a user creates a credentials set using `porter credentials generate`. This is a mapping that tells porter "given a name of a credential such as `github_token`, where can the value be found?", possible locations of a credential are: result of a command, environment value, file path, or hard coded value. The generate command walks you through all the credentials used by a bundle and where the values can be found.

Now when you execute the bundle you can pass the credential set to the command use `--cred` or `-c` flag, e.g. `porter install --cred github`. Before the bundle is executed, porter users the credential set's mappings to retrieve the credential values and then inject them into the bundle's execution environment, e.g. the docker container, as environment variables.

Inside the bundle's execution environment Porter looks for those environment variables that represent the credentials and replaces the template placeholders like `{{ bundle.credentials.github_token }}` with the actual credential value before executing the step.

Once the bundle finishes executing, the credentials are NOT recorded in the bundle instance (claim). Parameters are recorded there so that you can view them later using `porter instances show NAME --output json`.
