# Getting Started

* [What is the project?](#what-is-the-project)
* [What can you work on?](#what-can-you-work-on)
* [Who can be a maintainer?](#who-can-be-a-maintainer)

## What is the project?

[Porter][porter] is a command-line tool written in Go that implements the [Cloud
Native Application Bundle Specification](https://deislabs.io/cnab). Package your
application artifact, client tools, configuration and deployment logic together
as a versioned bundle that you can distribute, and then install with a single
command.

## Where should you start?

Every new contributor should read our [Code of Conduct][conduct] and use our
[Contributing Guide][contributing] to understand what to expect when
contributing to our repositories. The guide also covers the project's code
structure, makefile commands, how to preview documentation and other useful
things to know.

The contributing guide explains how to [find an issue][find-an-issue]. We do use
two labels: [good first issue][good-first-issue] for new contributors and [help
wanted][help-wanted] issues for our other contributors.

* `good first issue` has extra information to help you make your first contribution.
* `help wanted` are issues suitable for someone who isn't a maintainer and usually 
   also has extra guidance.

## What can you work on?

We need help with everything! üòä Whether you are new to Go or cloud-native
gopher expert, are interested in design or writing, we have stuff for you to
do:

* Add commands to the porter cli. This is work that never ends and is suitable
  for all levels of gophers.
* Create a mixin! You can start use the [Porter Skeletor][skeletor] repository
  as a template to start, along with the [Mixin Developer Guide][mixin-dev-guide].
* Coordinate between writing an upstream CNAB specification, such as security or 
  dependencies, and implementing it in Porter.
* Implement new runtimes so that Porter can work inside Kubernetes, and other 
  virtualization providers.
* Improve our website's design by contributing diagrams, graphics, improved layouts,
  organizing the information.
* Fill in gaps in our documentation by copying answers from Slack and GitHub into 
  our FAQ, or creating new pages and content.
* Project management or other skillsets would be amazing as well! Contact
  Carolyn and let's coordiante. üôå

The [roadmap][roadmap] will give you a good idea of the larger features that we
are working on right now. That may help you decide what you would like to work
on after you have tackled an issue or two to learn how to contribute to Porter.
If you would like to contribute regularly to a larger issue on the roadmap,
reach out to a maintainer on [Slack][slack].

## Who can be a maintainer?

Porter is not a Microsoft-only project. Anyone can not only contribute but
work their way up the [contribution ladder][ladder] from contributor to 
maintainer to admin.
