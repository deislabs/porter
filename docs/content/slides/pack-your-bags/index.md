## porter install

```console
$ porter install --help
Install a bundle.

The first argument is the name of the claim to create for the installation. 
The claim name defaults to the name of the bundle.

Flags:
  -c, --cred strings         Credential to use when installing the bundle. 
  -f, --file string          Path to the bundle file to install.
      --param strings        Define an individual parameter in the form NAME=VALUE.
      --param-file strings   Path to a parameters definition file for the bundle
```

## CNAB: What Executes Where

TODO PICTURE

## Try it out: porter install

```console
$ porter install

installing HELLO...
executing porter install configuration from /cnab/app/porter.yaml
Install Hello World
Hello World
execution completed successfully!
```

---
name: mellamo
class: center

# Tutorial
# Hi, My Name is _

---
name: parameters

## Parameters

Variables in your bundle that you can specify when you execute the bundle
and are loaded into the bundle either as environment variables or files.

### Define a Paramer
```yaml
parameters:
- name: name
  type: string
  default: llama
```

### Use a Parameter
```yaml
- "echo Hello, {{ bundle.parameters.name }}"
```

* Needs double quotes around the yaml entry
* Needs double curly braces around the templating
* Uses the format `bundle.parameters.PARAMETER_NAME`

???
Explain defaults and when parameters are required

---

## Try it out: Print Your Name

Modify the hello bundle to print "Hello, YOUR NAME", for example "Hello, Aarti", using a parameter.

1. Edit the porter.yaml to define a parameter named `name`.
1. Use the parameter in the `install` action and echo your name.
1. Rebuild your bundle with `porter build`.
1. Finally run `porter install -p name=YOUR_NAME` and look for your name in the output.

---

### porter bundle list

```console
$ porter bundle list
NAME          CREATED         MODIFIED        LAST ACTION   LAST STATUS
HELLO_LLAMA   5 seconds ago   3 seconds ago   install       success
HELLO         8 minutes ago   8 minutes ago   install       success
```

???
Ask them to list their bundles

---
name: claims

### Claims

Claims are records of any actions performed by CNAB compliant tools on a bundle.

```console
$ cat ~/.porter/claims/HELLO.json
{
  "name": "HELLO",
  "revision": "01DCFCN6AH00SM8E1968XHTSJ5",
  "created": "2019-06-03T14:22:00.952704-05:00",
  "modified": "2019-06-03T14:22:02.449355-05:00",
  "result": {
    "message": "",
    "action": "install",
    "status": "success"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "porter-debug": false,
    "name": "llama"
  },
  ...
}
```

---
name: cleanup-hello
## Cleanup Hello World

First run `porter uninstall` without any arguments:
```console
$ porter uninstall
uninstalling HELLO...
executing porter uninstall configuration from /cnab/app/porter.yaml
Uninstall Hello World
Goodbye World
execution completed successfully!
```

Now run `porter uninstall` with the name you used for the modified bundle:
```console
$ porter uninstall HELLO_LLAMA
uninstalling HELLO_LLAMA...
executing porter uninstall configuration from /cnab/app/porter.yaml
Uninstall Hello llama
Goodbye llama
execution completed successfully!
```

name: credentials

## Credentials

Variables that can be specified when the bundle is executed that are _associated with the identity 
of the user executing the bundle_, and are loaded into the bundle either as environment variables or files.

They are mapped from the local system using named credential sets, instead of specified on the command-line.

---
name: passwords

## Credentials, Passwords and Sensitive Data

* Credentials are for data identifying data associated with a user. They are re-specified everytime you run a bundle, and are not stored in the claim.
* Parameters can store sensitive data using the `sensitive` flag. This prevents the value from being printed to the console.
* We (porter) and the CNAB spec are working on more robust storage mechanisms for claims with sensitive data, and better ways to pull data from secret stores so that they don't end up on the file system unencrypted.

In all honesty this area is a work in progress. I would shove as everything in a credential for now but be aware of the distinction and where the CNAB spec is moving.

---

## porter credentials generate

```console
$ porter credentials generate --help
Generate a named set of credentials.

The first argument is the name of credential set you wish to generate. If not
provided, this will default to the bundle name. By default, Porter will
generate a credential set for the bundle in the current directory. You may also
specify a bundle with --file.

Bundles define 1 or more credential(s) that are required to interact with a
bundle. The bundle definition defines where the credential should be delivered
to the bundle, i.e. at /root/.kube. A credential set, on the other hand,
represents the source data that you wish to use when interacting with the
bundle. These will typically be environment variables or files on your local
file system.

When you wish to install, upgrade or delete a bundle, Porter will use the
credential set to determine where to read the necessary information from and
will then provide it to the bundle in the correct location.
```

---

## Try it out: porter credentials generate

Generate a set of credentials for the wordpress bundle in this repository.

1. Change to the `wordpress` directory under the workshop materials
1. Run `porter credentials generate` and follow the interactive prompts to create a set of credentials
for the wordpress bundle.

---

## Wordpress Credential Mapping

### ~/.porter/credentials/wordpress.yaml
```yaml
name: wordpress
credentials:
- name: kubeconfig
  source:
    path: /Users/carolynvs/.kube/config
```

### porter.yaml
```yaml
credentials:
- name: kubeconfig
  path: /root/.kube/config
```

---

## Try it out: porter install --cred

Install the wordpress bundle and pass it the named set of credentials that you generated.

```console
$ porter install --cred wordpress
```

---
name: cleanup-wordpress

## Cleanup Wordpress

```console
$ porter uninstall --cred wordpress
```

???
Explain why --cred is required again for uninstall
