title: Contributing Tutorial
---

We are excited to have you join the Porter community! This tutorial will walk 
you through how to modify Porter and try out your changes. We encourage you to
follow the tutorial before submitting your first pull request because this will
help you get your environment set up and become familiar with how to make a change
and test it out.

If you run into any trouble, please let us know! The best way to ask for help is
to start a new discussion on our [forum].

## Try Porter

Before contributing to any open-source project, you should start with becoming
familiar with the software first. 

1. [Install Porter](/install/)
1. Run through the [QuickStart]

After this you should be able to answer:

* What is Porter?
* What is a bundle?
* How do I make a bundle?
* How do I install a bundle?

We are always iterating on our documentation. If something isn't clear and you
have read our [documentation], let us know by opening an issue. Say what you
were trying to learn about, where you looked, if you could find a relevant page,
and what still isn't clear. We can then answer your question and improve our docs
so the next person has a better experience.

## Setup Environment

First let's get your computer setup so that you can work on Porter. You will
need a few things.

We are improving our support for building Porter on Windows. In a few weeks, we
will have it all working on any Windows shell. For now, if you are on Windows,
please use [Windows Subsystem for Linux][wsl] (WSL). The rest of this tutorial
assumes that you are inside your WSL distribution when installing prerequisites
and executing the commands.

* [Git]
   
   If you are new to Git or GitHub, we recommend reading the [GitHub Guides].
   They will walk you through installing Git, forking a repository and
   submitting a pull request.
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.13 or higher
* [Docker]

## Checkout Code

Porter can either be cloned into your GOPATH (usually ~/go) or anywhere on your computer.

Porter has a couple repositories. You may want to clone Porter and its other
repositories into a dedicated directory so they are easier to find later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getporter/porter.git
```

## Build Porter

Now that we have the source code, let's build porter and make sure everything is working.

```bash
make build
```

You may see a message about your Go bin not being in your PATH. When go tools are installed, they automatically are put into GOPATH/bin and in order to use them that directory needs to be included in your PATH environment variable. This is a standard Go developer environment configuration and will be useful for other Go projects.

1. Open your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc file (depending on your OS you will
   have one or the other) and add the following line to the file:

    ```
    export PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH
    ```
1. Now load the changes to your bash profile with `source ~/.bash_profile` or
   `source ~/.bashrc`.
1. Run `make build` again and it should work. If it doesn't, please let us know!

## Verify Porter

After you have built Porter, the resulting `porter` command-line tool is placed in the bin directory. Let's try running porter to make sure everything worked:

```
./bin/porter help
```

Now you that you have built Porter, let's try running a bundle to make sure Docker is installed and configured properly too. This is an abbreviated version of our [QuickStart]. If you are new to Porter, we recommend trying the QuickStart as well to learn how Porter works.

First let's do some quick configuration so that you can use the porter executable that you just built, instead of the installed porter. This change isn't permanent and only affects your current shell session.

```bash
export PORTER_HOME=`pwd`/bin
alias porter=`pwd`/bin/porter
```

Let's use what you just built and verify that everything is working:

1. Make a temporary directory for your bundle:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /tmp/hello-world
    cd /tmp/hello-world
    ```
1. Create a new bundle:
    ```bash
    porter create
    ```
1. Build the bundle:
    ```bash
    porter build
    ```
1. Install the bundle:
    ```bash
    porter install
    ```
1. View your bundle's status by listing all installed bundles:
    ```bash
    porter list
    ```

## Change Porter

Let's make a change to Porter by adding a new command, `porter hello --name
YOURNAME` that prints `Hello YOURNAME!`.

1. Create a new file at pkg/porter/hello.go and paste the following content.

    This is the implementation of our new command. We are adding a new function
    to the `Porter` struct called `Hello` that accepts a `HelloOptions` struct
    containing the flags and arguments from the command. Our options struct
    has validation logic so that we can enforce rules such as `--name is required`.
    
    ```go
    package porter
    
    import (
        "fmt"
        
        "github.com/pkg/errors"
    )
    
    // Define flags and arguments for `porter hello`.
    type HelloOptions struct {
       Name string
    }
    
    // Validate the options passed to `porter hello`.
    func (o HelloOptions) Validate() error {
        if o.Name == "" {
            return errors.New("--name is required")
        }
        return nil
    }
    
    // Hello contains the implementation for `porter hello`.
    func (p *Porter) Hello(opts HelloOptions) error {
        fmt.Printf("Hello %s!\n", opts.Name)
        return nil
    }
    ```
1. Create a new file at cmd/porter/hello.go and open it in your editor.

    This is the definition of the command. It includes the name of the command,
    its help text displayed by `porter help`, defines the flags for the command,
    and says how to validate and run the command.
     
    ```go
    package main
    
    import (
        "get.porter.sh/porter/pkg/porter"
        "github.com/spf13/cobra"
    )
    
    func buildHelloCommand(p *porter.Porter) *cobra.Command {
        // Store arguments and flags specified by the user
        opts := porter.HelloOptions{}
        
        // Define the `porter hello` command
        cmd := &cobra.Command{
            Use:   "hello",
            Short: "Say hello",
            PreRunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
                return opts.Validate()
            },
            RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
                return p.Hello(opts)
            },
        }
        
        // Define the --name flag. Allow using -n too.
        cmd.Flags().StringVarP(&opts.Name, "name", "n", "", "Your name")
        return cmd
    }

    ```
1. Open cmd/porter/main.go and look for the line `cmd.AddCommand(buildVersionCommand(p))`.
    Add your new hello command to the supported commands by adding the following
    line before we add the version command:
    
    ```go
    cmd.AddCommand(buildHelloCommand(p))
    ```

## Test Your Changes

After you have modified Porter, let's rebuild and test your changes.

1. Build porter to incorporate your new command by running `make build`.
1. Run `./bin/porter hello --help` to see the helptext for your command.
1. Run `./bin/porter --name YOURNAME` to try out your new command.

```bash
$ porter hello --name Carolyn
Hello Carolyn!
```

## Celebrate!
