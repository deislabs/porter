# Porter Project Goveranance

This document outlines how the Porter project governs itself. The Porter project
consists of all of the repositories in the https://github.com/getporter
organization. 

Everyone who interacts with the project must abide by our [Code of Conduct]. 

## Legal

The Porter project is in the [CNCF Sandbox](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/). â›±

## Roles

We have a [Contribution Ladder] that explains the capabilities and
responsibilities of each role:

* Contributor
* Maintainer
* Admin

The [OWNERS] defines the current maintainers of the project.

## Release Process

Maintainers create the next release when the main branch is stable and related
groupings of work is complete. We do not have a fixed cadence and prefer to release
smaller batches of work more often.

## Roadmap

Our [Roadmap] is determined by where our maintainers have decided to volunteer
their time. We try to keep it up-to-date so that the community can see where the
project is headed but it is not a committment.
